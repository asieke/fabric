# How are you doing?

## Uses

**Here's some stuff I use**

- SvelteKit
- VS Code
- Emojis ðŸ˜Ž

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
	console.log('hello');
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint          | Method | Description                  |
| ----------------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| /api/users        | GET    | Get all users                |
| /api/users/:id    | GET    | Get a specific user by ID    |
| /api/users        | POST   | Create a new user            |
| /api/users/:id    | PUT    | Update a user by ID          |
| /api/users/:id    | DELETE | Delete a user by ID          |
| /api/products     | GET    | Get all products             |
| /api/products/:id | GET    | Get a specific product by ID |
| /api/products     | POST   | Create a new product         |
| /api/products/:id | PUT    | Update a product by ID       |
| /api/products/:id | DELETE | Delete a product by ID       |

Based on the code you provided, it seems that the API is used to interact with a database of users and products. The API provides several endpoints that allow you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data. For example, you can use the /api/users endpoint to get a list of all users, or you can use the /api/users/:id endpoint to get a specific user by their ID. Similarly, you can use the /api/products endpoint to get a list of all products, or you can use the /api/products/:id endpoint to get a specific product by its ID. The API supports HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, which allow you to retrieve, create, update, and delete data as needed.

```json
GET /api/users HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

[
	{
		"id": 1,
		"name": "John Doe",
		"email": "johndoe@example.com"
	},
	{
		"id": 2,
		"name": "Jane Doe",
		"email": "janedoe@example.com"
	}
]
```

## Helpful Tips

1. Familiarize yourself with the available endpoints and their corresponding HTTP methods. This will help you understand how to interact with the API and perform the necessary CRUD operations on the data.

2. Use the appropriate HTTP method for each endpoint. For example, use GET to retrieve data, POST to create new data, PUT to update existing data, and DELETE to remove data.

3. Make sure to include the necessary parameters in your API requests. For example, when retrieving a specific user or product, you will need to include the ID of the user or product in the request URL.

4. Handle errors appropriately. The API may return error responses if there are issues with your requests, such as missing parameters or invalid data. Make sure to handle these errors in your code and provide appropriate feedback to the user
